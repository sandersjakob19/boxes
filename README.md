# boxes
quadratic prime test

This test is designed only for numbers that are congruent to 5 mod 6.
If you wrote into two columns numbers 1mod6 and 5mod6, you are able
to look at a pattern in which boxes occur. Some more mathematical
meddling gives you a quadratic equation for numbers 5mod6. This
test is not faster than a standard test.
